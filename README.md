MathPL 📏
Mathematical programming language for BASIC mathematics
---
⚠️ The project is under development and may contain errors and shortcomings! ⚠️

**This project is my personal hobby and does not claim to compete with other programming languages.**

🧑‍💻 MathPL code example that calculates the square of the sum of five and the ratio of five to pi:

```python
x = (5 + 5 / module.pi())^2
print(Variable x equals {x})
```

💻 Features to be implemented in the future:

- [ ] Support for outputting information to the console using functions and mathematical operations
- [ ] Support for root extraction and trigonometric functions
- [ ] Support for arrays and matrices for working with multidimensional data
- [ ] Support for numerical methods for solving equations, integrals, differentials and optimization
- [ ] Graph support to visualize calculation results
- [ ] File output support for saving results
- [ ] Modularity support for splitting code into logical parts
---
💻 What has already been done?

- [x] Create variables
- [x] Functions
- [x] Create custom functions
- [x] Output information (so far only variables)
- [x] Play code from files
- [x] Ability to display information without the print() function
